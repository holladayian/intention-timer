### Template for DTR Memo ##

**Project:** Intention Timer

**Group Member Names:** Ian Holladay, Kyle Jones, Rachel Williams

**Goals and Expectations for the Project (What does each group member hope to get out of this project? What do we want to achieve as a team? How will we know that we're successful?):**  
Our goal is to complete the entire project. Along the way, we want to make sure that every teammate understands every line of code and that we take the time to refactor as well.

**Team strengths & collaboration styles (consider discussing your Pairin qualities here):**  
Day by day, we will look at the work to be done and decide if it makes most sense to code together (driver/navigator) or split up the work to do individually. If we split it up, we will make sure to come together for code review and to ensure everyone understands each line of code.

**How we can use our strengths to overcome obstacles:**  
If we get stuck on our invidual work, we can always come together to talk it through and find a solution.

**Schedule Expectations (When are we available to work together and individually? What constraints do we have? Make sure to discuss the remote questions above in regards to this section):**  
Our target is to meet around 5pm to start working. We will aim to take breaks strategically, generally around every hour or so, but we will play it by ear. Generally, we will put aside 3-4 hours/day for this.

**Communication Expectations (How and often will we communicate? How do we keep lines of communication open? How will we make decisions as a team? How will we communicate about our emotional and mental well-being with each other?):**  
We should be in contact at least once a day, even if we are doing individual work. At 5, we will meet to decide how to approach the work. Additionally, for each merge, we will meet to talk through any conflicts.

**Abilities & Growth Expectations (Technical strengths and areas for desired improvement):**  
We want to develop better skills in writing semantic HTML, clean and organized CSS styles, and dry and organized JavaScript.

**Workflow Expectations (Git workflow/Tools/Code Review/Reviewing Pull Requests/Debugging and Problem-solving Techniques):**  
For each pull request, we will make sure the other 2 team members have reviewed the code before it is merged. We will also make sure to make small, atomic commits. We will also use branches for every feature.


**Expectations for giving and receiving feedback:**  
Feedback should be kind but also precise and direct.

**Day 1 Agenda:**   
Get through Iteration 0

**Timeline:**  
Our goal is to complete one iteration per day. This gives us a few extra days if we get stuck or need to do a lot of refactoring.
